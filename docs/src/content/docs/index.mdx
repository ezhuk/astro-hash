## Why Astro Hash?

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Ensure resource integrity" icon="open-book">
    Automatically computed *Subresource Integrity (SRI)* hashes let browsers verify that your CSS and JS files have not been tampered with, protecting your site against supply-chain attacks.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Simplify CSP enforcement" icon="warning">
    By injecting *Content Security Policy (CSP)* hashes into your build output, you can adopt a strict Content Security Policy, reducing the risk of cross-site scripting.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
